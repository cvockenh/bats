					<h1>What does the program?</h1>
					<p>BATS, written in the computer platform independent programming language <a href="www.java.com">JAVA</a>, is able to calculate the final results of AMS measurements for individual unknown samples with their uncertainties based on the multiple measurement of a set of samples. This set is typically one cassette or one sample wheel with the related number of samples, including standards and blanks. There is also the option to combine several subsequently measured sample sets, if measurement conditions were stable enough to consistently evaluate them simultaneously. Beside the straightforward <a href="standard.html">normalization</a> and the <a href="blank.html">blank</a> subtraction procedure a number of corrections can by applied to the initial data. These corrections are executed on the results of the single measurements of individual samples, before sample means are calculated. The idea behind this approach is to separate systematic effects from the fundamental uncertainty of the results based on its counting statistics. Such systematic effects, if present, can cause a significantly higher standard deviation of the raw results from repeated measurement of a single sample than expected from their internal counting statistic. Under favourable conditions, the applied corrections reduce the standard deviations towards the internal (counting statistic based) uncertainty. BATS shows this based on chi-square tests comparing the uncertainty from counting statistics with the standard deviation.</p>
