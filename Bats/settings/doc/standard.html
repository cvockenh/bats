					<h1>Standard</h1>
					<p>First, the weighted mean ratio of all individual standards is calculated. Second, the mean of means is calculated. In case there is no significant difference between a single measurement and the mean of means, the corresponding normalization factor is used for all the measurements to obtain corrected single-measurement results. Otherwise it has to be tested, if individual standards will not reflect the true nominal ratio or if there is an external error contributing in addition to the internal counting statistic error. The sources for an external error are often difficult to determine as they can be either related to sample and target preparation or to the measurement itself.</p>
					<p>Standards have to be defined in the <i><span class="cit">Table of standards</span></i>. Samples with<i> <span class="cit">sampletype</span></i> equal to a name of the <i><span class="cit">Table of standards</span></i> are taken as standards.</p>
					<p>In the standard plot the ratio measured for the nominal value (can be set in <span class="cit"><a href="preferences.html">Prefereces</a></span>) . For radiocarbon the transformation from a ratio to pmC is included! That means that ra_fin is not a ratio, but the uncorrected pmC value (not corrected to -25). </p>
